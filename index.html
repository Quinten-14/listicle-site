          <h3>Pre-Production</h3>
          <p>
            Pre-Production is the part of game development that can take the
            most time. Every small feature and mechanic needs to be talked about
            and planned. It's also needed to research the style the game will be
            in and find some reference for the stages later on in development.
            This step is really needed if you want your game to succeed and not
            feel like it is glued togheter.

        <h3>Story Writing</h3>
        <p>Story Writing is mainly used to give the game an objective. It makes the game feel like one big story and not all just seperate levels. Good story writing can take ages. Writing a story for a game is even harder then doing this for a movie. A movie follows a liniar story and you only see what the makers want you to see. Most games in this time of age have some really large stories. For example bethesda's fallout series. You have the main story but you can approach this from different angles. Also there is the point that most games have a main story and then side stories. A big example of a great written story is Cyberpunk 2077. The game has a main story but the endings get decided by the choices you make in the game. Also it has a lot of side-quest and every person you interact with has a story behind it that you can explore.</p>

        <h3>Concept Art</h3>
        <p>
          Concept Art is the part where artists start to sketch around in their favorite software to give a vision of how the game will look and feel. This is a really important step for the 3D modelers later on. Good concept art can help them a lot and make their life a lot easier. Concept art is a skill that is easy to learn but hard to master. Concept artists need to be really creative and know what works best togheter. They have some rules that they need to apply to so the drawings can be straight forward and understood by the other artists. Concept artists also need to know the story and that way they can connect the story to different props or buildings in the game. Most games come with a concept art book when you buy a special edition for it and that is just to show you how much the game has improved over time and what the main idea's were in the beginnning.
          <br>
          <br>
           One of my favorite concept artists is Ryan Church. He has worked on games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. He has a really unique style and I love how he can make a drawing look so real. He also has a youtube channel where he shows how he makes his drawings and how he thinks about them. He also has a lot of tutorials on his channel that are really helpful. My favorite game on the topic concept art is Horizon Zero Dawn. The book is amazing and it shows how much work went into the game. I really recommend it to everyone who is interested in concept art.

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>
          Coding games isn't easy. The first decision people need to make is what language they are going to use. This also heavily depends on the game engine. For example Unreal Engine by epic games uses C++ and blueprints (blueprints is their visual coding solution and is great for new coders). Unity uses C# and bolt (bolt is their visual scripting tool but this is a lot harder to use then blueprints). For beginners I would recommend C# or blueprints. C++ is really hard for beginners and mistakes are easily made. Most AAA companies that make games use their own game engine. Some examples are Frostbite by EA, CryEngine by Crytek and Source by Valve. These game engines are really hard to use and you need to know a lot of coding to make a game with them. Making a game engine is by no means easy and most of these engines took years to develop to the point they are now. You don't need to make your own game engine to make a popular game. Fortnite was made with Unreal Engine and many great games with unity. Coding these games are not easy and it will take time to learn but if you are able to pull this of it is definetly worth it.

        <h3>Design & Modeling</h3>
        <p>
          Designing and modeling is the part where the game starts to look like a game. This is the part where the artists start to make the game look like the concept art. Designing and modeling is a really hard part of game development. It takes a lot of time and effort to make a good looking game. Most AAA games have a lot of models in them and that takes a lot of time to make. The models also need to be optimized so the game can run on a lot of different devices. The models also need to be made in a way that they can be animated. Design also includes sound design. Sound can make the game feel a lot more real and it will really make you feel like you are in the game. My favorite game with sound definetly is Battlefield 1. The sound in that game is so great that it feels like you are really in the WW1 trenches figting off some bad guys.

        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>
          Animation is by far the hardest part of game development in my opinion. This is really time consuming and some small mistakes can ruin your work and set you back a few hours. In AAA studios this is a bit easier because they use MoCap Suits. These suits are expensive and not everyone can afford them. The suits are used to record the movements of the actors and then the animators can use that to make the animations. This is a lot easier then making the animations by hand. The animators also need to know the story and that way they can make the animations fit the story. The animations also need to be made in a way that they can be used in the game. The animations also need to be optimized so the game can run on a lot of different devices. My favorite game with animations is Horizon Zero Dawn. The animations in that game are so good that it feels like you are really in the game. The animations are so good that you can't even tell that the game is made by a small team.

        <h3>Testing & Publishing</h3>
        <p>
          The last thing to do it test the game and make changes where needed. This is important to find game breaking bugs & glitches that need to be solved before releasing the game. It also needs to be tested on a lot of different devices to ensure that the game runs good on them. After that publishing is the last step. Build a brand around the game and promote it a bit. Make some good footage trailers and screenshots and put them on your sale page. Choose a good platform to release your game on and don't hesitate to do it. If you completed this step you have succesfully build a game and you can be proud of yourself.
